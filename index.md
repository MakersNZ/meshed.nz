The purpose of Meshed is to act as a bridge connecting Makers, Communities & Patrons.

Meshed intends to be a Social Enterprise, with the objective of empowering Makers to serve the community by pursuing their passions, and doing so in a sustainable manner.

What this actually means â€“ â€˜elevator pitchâ€™ aside â€“ is that we are a collective of individuals & groups of people, shared values and vision, with a passion for Making & the (Free Culture) Maker-community, who want to continue doing good work, commit themselves to it as a vocation, but who also want to be able to eat, pay rent, or afford to take a day off to spend with our families.

You know â€“ the little things in life that make it all worth while ðŸ™‚

We plan on achieving this objective by working with other communities, groups and people together on projects & activities that has a beneficial outcome to the wider Makers â€˜ecosystemâ€™, and â€“ we hope â€“ our communities & society as a whole.

We endeavour to create a safe and fertile creative environment where people from diverse backgrounds can express themselves, their stories and ideas, but one where we â€“ as a collective and organisation â€“ can help support each other by sharing the responsibilities associated with good, running a sustainable endeavour.
